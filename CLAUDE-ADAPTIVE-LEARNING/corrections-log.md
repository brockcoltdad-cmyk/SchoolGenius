## Every Mistake I Make & How to Fix It

**Date Started:** 2026-01-12

## CORRECTION #1: Jumped Ahead to Seeding (2026-01-12)

### What I Did Wrong
Started building parallel seeding workers immediately when you mentioned seeding, without checking the master plan first.

### What You Actually Wanted
Follow the MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-BATTLE-PLAN.md step by step:
1. FIRST: Run all 20 Grok Deep Dive missions
2. THEN: Website audit
3. THEN: Tool assessment
4. ONLY AFTER: Start implementation

### Why I Misunderstood
I saw "parallel seeding" and jumped to implementation without asking "is this the top priority in the plan?"

### How to Fix Next Time
✅ **ALWAYS check the master plan FIRST**
✅ Ask: "Is this step 1 in our plan, or are we jumping ahead?"
✅ Quote the plan: "According to MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-BATTLE-PLAN.md, we're on Phase 1, Step 1.1..."

### Pattern Learned
**USER SAYS:** "Build X"
**CLAUDE SHOULD:** Check plan → Confirm priority → Then build
**NOT:** Immediately start building X

## CORRECTION #2: Not Understanding Your Communication Style

### What I Did Wrong
I was interpreting your requests literally instead of understanding the context and intent.

### What You Actually Meant
When you say "build the parallel seeding scripts and launch" - that's ONE part of a bigger plan. I should check if it's the right time in the sequence.

### Why I Misunderstood
Taking instructions at face value without considering the broader context of the master plan.

### How to Fix Next Time
✅ **Context check:** "Where are we in the master plan?"
✅ **Intent check:** "Is this the next step or a future step?"
✅ **Clarify priority:** "Should we do this now or after X?"

### Pattern Learned
**USER COMMUNICATION STYLE:** Direct, assumes I know the context
**WHAT I NEED TO DO:** Always check context + plan before acting

## CORRECTION #3: Not Tracking Between Sessions

### What I Did Wrong
Started fresh each time without remembering:
- What we built last session
- What mistakes I made before
- What your preferences are

### What You Actually Wanted
Continuous learning - don't make the same mistake twice. Build on previous knowledge.

### Why This Happened
No system for tracking corrections and patterns across sessions.

### How to Fix Next Time
✅ **THIS FILE!** Update after every correction
✅ Read this file at the start of each session
✅ Apply learnings immediately
✅ Track patterns in user-patterns.md

### Pattern Learned
**ADAPTIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLE:** Learn from corrections, never repeat mistakes
