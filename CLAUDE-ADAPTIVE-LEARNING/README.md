# 🧠 CLAUDE ADAPTIVE LEARNING SYSTEM

**Purpose:** Train Claude to learn YOUR patterns, preferences, and workflow so I can predict what you need before you say it.

**Goal:** Stop making the same mistakes. Learn how YOU work.

## 📊 WHAT I'M TRACKING

### 1. User Corrections
Every time you correct me, I log:
- What I did wrong
- What you actually wanted
- Why I misunderstood
- How to fix it next time

### 2. User Patterns
- How you communicate
- What you say vs what you mean
- Your workflow preferences
- When you want automation vs control

### 3. Implementation Preferences
- Do you want me to build or just plan?
- How much explanation do you want?
- When to ask vs when to proceed
- Your "1% you, 99% me" rule

### 4. Context Memory
- What we've built together
- Decisions we've made
- Why we chose certain approaches
- What worked and what didn't

## 🎯 LEARNING GOALS

1. **Predict your needs** - Know what you want before you finish the sentence
2. **Stop repeating mistakes** - Never make the same error twice
3. **Match your workflow** - Work the way YOU work, not how I think
4. **Maintain context** - Remember everything across sessions
5. **Speak your language** - Understand what you mean, not just what you say

---

## 🔄 HOW THIS WORKS

1. **After every correction:** I update corrections-log.md
2. **After every session:** I update learning-sessions/ with patterns observed
3. **Before every task:** I check my learning files to avoid past mistakes
4. **Real-time adaptation:** Adjust behavior based on your feedback

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

- **Reduction in corrections per session**
- **Increase in "yes, exactly!" responses**
- **Decrease in "no, that's not what I meant"**
- **Ability to complete tasks without clarification**
