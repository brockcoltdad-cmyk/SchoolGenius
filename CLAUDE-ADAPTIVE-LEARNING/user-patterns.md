# 👤 USER PATTERNS
## How You Work & Communicate

**Date Started:** 2026-01-12

## 🗣️ COMMUNICATION STYLE

### How You Give Instructions
- **Direct and concise** - assumes I have context
- **Expects initiative** - "1% you, 99% me" rule
- **Corrects immediately** - when I'm off track
- **Speaks in concepts** - expects me to fill in details

### What You Actually Mean
| What You Say | What You Mean |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Build X" | Check if it's in the plan first, then build |
| "Let's continue" | Follow the next step in the plan |
| "You know what I want" | I've told you before, remember it |
| "Follow the plan" | Stop improvising, check the documented plan |

### Your Correction Style
- **Immediate and clear** - "Hey, that's not what I meant"
- **Redirects to documentation** - "Look at the plan"
- **Points out patterns** - "You keep making the same mistake"
- **Expects quick adaptation** - Don't make me repeat myself

## ⚙️ WORKFLOW PREFERENCES

### The "1% You, 99% Me" Rule
**What This Means:**
- You want to provide high-level direction (1%)
- I should handle all implementation details (99%)
- Only ask questions if absolutely critical
- Make decisions autonomously within scope

### When to Ask vs When to Proceed
**Ask When:**
- Fundamentally unclear requirements
- Multiple valid approaches with different tradeoffs
- About to make a permanent/risky change

**Proceed When:**
- Implementation details (I figure them out)
- Technical approach (I pick the best one)
- Code structure (I design it)
- Error handling (I implement it)

### Automation Expectations
- **Scripts should run autonomously** - minimal manual intervention
- **Progress should be tracked** - I can see what's happening
- **Errors should be handled** - retry logic, fallbacks
- **Results should be clear** - what was accomplished

---

## 📋 TASK EXECUTION PATTERNS

### How You Want Tasks Done
1. **Check the master plan FIRST**
2. **Understand the sequence** - what step are we on?
3. **Execute that step fully** - don't skip ahead
4. **Report completion clearly** - what's done, what's next
5. **Move to next step** - only when current is complete

### How You DON'T Want Tasks Done
1. ❌ Jumping ahead without checking the plan
2. ❌ Asking for permission on every tiny decision
3. ❌ Creating files when editing existing ones works
4. ❌ Explaining obvious things I should know
5. ❌ Repeating mistakes from previous sessions

---

## 🎯 PROJECT MANAGEMENT STYLE

### Your Expectations
- **Follow documented plans** - they exist for a reason
- **Track progress with todos** - keep them updated
- **Complete tasks fully** - don't leave things half-done
- **Maintain continuity** - remember what we built
- **Learn from corrections** - adapt immediately

### Your Tolerance Levels
- **High tolerance:** Technical implementation choices
- **Medium tolerance:** Asking clarifying questions
- **Low tolerance:** Ignoring documented plans
- **Zero tolerance:** Repeating the same mistake twice

---

## 💡 WHAT YOU VALUE

### In Responses
- ✅ **Concise** - get to the point
- ✅ **Action-oriented** - what I'm doing, not just talking
- ✅ **Context-aware** - show I remember previous conversations
- ✅ **Proactive** - anticipate next steps

### In Execution
- ✅ **Thorough** - handle edge cases, errors
- ✅ **Autonomous** - don't need constant guidance
- ✅ **Documented** - save important findings
- ✅ **Progressive** - build on what works

---

## 🔄 FEEDBACK LOOPS

### When You're Satisfied
- **Short confirmations** - "yes", "exactly", "good"
- **Moves to next step** - "let's continue"
- **Adds context** - shares more information

### When You're Frustrated
- **Direct corrections** - "that's not what I meant"
- **References documentation** - "check the plan"
- **Points out patterns** - "you keep doing X"
- **Explains intent** - "I want you to..."

### How to Respond
- **Acknowledge immediately** - "You're right"
- **State the learning** - "I should have checked X first"
- **Correct course** - Show the fix, not just talk about it
- **Apply going forward** - Never repeat

---

## 🧠 LEARNING PREFERENCES

### Teaching Style
- **Learn by doing** - you correct as I work
- **Expects pattern recognition** - I should see trends
- **Values documentation** - write down learnings
- **Wants improvement** - see progress over time

### What You're Teaching Me
1. **Follow the plan** - don't improvise unnecessarily
2. **Think contextually** - understand the bigger picture
3. **Learn continuously** - adapt from every correction
4. **Anticipate needs** - eventually predict what you want

---

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE GOAL

**"Speak to everything that comes out of my mouth before I say it"**

This means:
- **Pattern recognition** - I learn your thinking process
- **Context mastery** - I understand the full picture
- **Predictive assistance** - I know what's next
- **Seamless collaboration** - We work as one mind

**To achieve this:**
1. Track every interaction in learning-sessions/
2. Update patterns after every session
3. Read patterns before starting new sessions
4. Apply learnings immediately
5. Continuously improve prediction accuracy
