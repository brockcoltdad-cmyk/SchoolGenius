## 8. Content Generation Rules

The "Pre-Implementation Checklist" ensures all content is age-appropriate before creation.

- **Checklist Before Content Creation**:
  - Does this involve user-facing content?
  - If YES, does it have 4 age-appropriate versions?
    - K-2 version (super simple, excited)
    - 3-5 version (friendly, encouraging)
    - 6-8 version (mature, respectful)
    - 9-12 version (professional, academic)
  - Are the tone, language, and complexity appropriate for each age?
  - Are emojis used appropriately for each age?
  - Are examples relatable to each age group?
  - Is the visual design age-appropriate?

- **Ensuring Age-Appropriateness**:
  - Ask: "Who is this for?" (Kindergartner, 5th grader, 8th grader, high schooler).
  - Ask: "How would they say it?" (Adjust response based on typical expressions of confusion or success).
  - Ask: "What words do they know?" (Match vocabulary to grade level).
  - Ask: "How much can they handle at once?" (Adjust steps and complexity).

- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Using the same message for all ages.
  - Talking down to high schoolers.
  - Using complex words with young kids.
  - Overusing emojis with teens.
  - Assuming everyone knows the same things.
  - Using baby talk with middle schoolers.

## 9. Seeding Implications

Content seeding must account for age differentiation, significantly increasing the volume of content.

- **Multiplier Effect**:
  - Original plan: 591 items.
  - With age-appropriate versions: 591 × 4 = 2,364 items.

- **Content Needing 4 Age Versions**:
  - Analogies (e.g., subject-specific explanations).
  - Kid responses (e.g., "I don't get it").
  - Transitions.
  - Achievements.
  - Greetings.
  - Return messages.
  - Gigi personality traits.

- **Age-Neutral Content**:
  - Parent guides (same for all ages, 1 version).

- **Total Item Count**:
  - Kid stuck responses: 85 × 4 = 340
  - Subject analogies: 275 × 4 = 1,100
  - Parent guides: 28 × 1 = 28
  - Transitions: 75 × 4 = 300
  - Achievements: 42 × 4 = 168
  - Greetings: 16 × 4 = 64
  - Return messages: 20 × 4 = 80
  - Gigi personality: 50 × 4 = 200
  - **Total: 2,280 items**
  - **Cost Estimate**: 2,280 × $0.001 = $2.28

## 10. Implementation Details

Technical implementation ensures age group detection and content selection are seamless.

- **getAgeGroup() Function Code**:
  ```typescript
  function getAgeGroup(gradeLevel: number | string): 'k2' | 'grades35' | 'grades68' | 'grades912' {
    const grade = typeof gradeLevel === 'string'
      ? gradeLevel.toLowerCase().startsWith('k') ? 0 : parseInt(gradeLevel)
      : gradeLevel

    if (grade <= 2) return 'k2'
    if (grade <= 5) return 'grades35'
    if (grade <= 8) return 'grades68'
    return 'grades912'
  }
  ```

- **How Age is Determined**:
  - Age group is derived from the student’s grade level (`child.grade_level`).
  - Grade level can be a number or string (e.g., "K" for Kindergarten maps to 0).
  - Function maps grade to one of four categories: 'k2', 'grades35', 'grades68', 'grades912'.

- **Where Age Group is Stored**:
  - Not explicitly stored; dynamically calculated from `grade_level` in the user profile or database.

- **How Age-Appropriate Content is Selected**:
  - Usage in seeding or runtime:
    ```typescript
    const ageGroup = getAgeGroup(child.grade_level)
    const response = getAgeAppropriateResponse('stuck', 'math', ageGroup)
    ```
  - Content libraries or responses are tagged with age group identifiers, and the appropriate version is retrieved based on the calculated `ageGroup`.

- **Code Examples for Age Detection**:
  - See `getAgeGroup()` above for primary detection logic.
  - Ensures content generation or retrieval respects the student’s developmental stage.
