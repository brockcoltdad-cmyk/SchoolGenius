## 📝 CONTENT GENERATION RULES

### When Generating ANY Content, Ask:

1. **Who is this for?**
   - Kindergartner? = Super simple, excited tone
   - 5th grader? = Friendly, building confidence
   - 8th grader? = Mature, respectful
   - High schooler? = Professional, academic

2. **How would they say it?**
   - K-2: "I don't get it!" → "Oops! Let's try again! 😊"
   - 3-5: "This is hard!" → "This is challenging, but you've got this! 💪"
   - 6-8: "I'm confused!" → "Let's analyze this together! 🔍"
   - 9-12: "Help!" → "Need clarification? Let's review the concept! 🔬"

3. **What words do they know?**
   - K-2: "big", "small", "share", "groups"
   - 3-5: "multiply", "calculate", "understand", "solve"
   - 6-8: "analyze", "evaluate", "determine", "apply"
   - 9-12: "synthesize", "deduce", "extrapolate", "demonstrate"

4. **How much can they handle at once?**
   - K-2: ONE step at a time
   - 3-5: 2-3 steps
   - 6-8: Multi-step processes
   - 9-12: Complex, multi-layered concepts

## 🌱 SEEDING IMPLICATIONS

### Every Seeding Script MUST Generate 4 Versions!

**Example: "I don't get it" Response**

**K-2 Version:**
```
"I hear you! Sometimes this is tricky! 😊 Let's try together! Want me to show you a fun way to think about it? You've got this! 💪"
```

**3-5 Version:**
```
"I understand - this concept can be challenging! 🤔 Let's break it down into smaller steps. Can you try the first part? I'll help you through it! 💡"
```

**6-8 Version:**
```
"Let's review this concept together! 🔍 Sometimes approaching it from a different angle helps. What part is confusing you? I can explain it another way! 🔄"
```

**9-12 Version:**
```
"Let's analyze where the confusion is coming from. 🔬 Would a different explanation help? I can break down the underlying concept in more detail! 📚"
```

## 📊 SEEDING COUNT MULTIPLIER

**Original plan:** 591 items
**WITH age-appropriate versions:** 591 × 4 = **2,364 items**

**But wait! Some content doesn't need 4 versions:**
- Analogies: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Kid responses: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Parent guides: Same for all ages (NEED 1 version)
- Transitions: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Achievements: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Greetings: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Return messages: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)
- Gigi personality: Vary by age (NEED 4 versions)

**Smart count:**
- Kid stuck responses: 85 × 4 = 340
- Subject analogies: 275 × 4 = 1,100
- Parent guides: 28 × 1 = 28
- Transitions: 75 × 4 = 300
- Achievements: 42 × 4 = 168
- Greetings: 16 × 4 = 64
- Return messages: 20 × 4 = 80
- Gigi personality: 50 × 4 = 200

**TOTAL: 2,280 items**

**Cost: 2,280 × $0.001 = $2.28** (still super cheap!)

## 🎯 AGE-GROUP DETECTION

### How to Determine Age Group in Code

```typescript
function getAgeGroup(gradeLevel: number | string): 'k2' | 'grades35' | 'grades68' | 'grades912' {
  const grade = typeof gradeLevel === 'string'
    ? gradeLevel.toLowerCase().startsWith('k') ? 0 : parseInt(gradeLevel)
    : gradeLevel

  if (grade <= 2) return 'k2'
  if (grade <= 5) return 'grades35'
  if (grade <= 8) return 'grades68'
  return 'grades912'
}

// Usage in seeding
const ageGroup = getAgeGroup(child.grade_level)
const response = getAgeAppropriateResponse('stuck', 'math', ageGroup)
```

---

## 📋 PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

**Before implementing ANYTHING, ask:**

```
□ Does this involve user-facing content?
□ If YES, does it have 4 age-appropriate versions?
  □ K-2 version (super simple, excited)
  □ 3-5 version (friendly, encouraging)
  □ 6-8 version (mature, respectful)
  □ 9-12 version (professional, academic)
□ Are the tone, language, and complexity appropriate for each age?
□ Are emojis used appropriately for each age?
□ Are examples relatable to each age group?
□ Is the visual design age-appropriate?
```

**If any checkbox is unchecked, STOP and fix it!**

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use the same message for all ages
- Talk down to high schoolers
- Use complex words with young kids
- Over-emoji with teens
- Assume everyone knows the same things
- Use baby talk with middle schoolers

### ✅ DO:
- Create 4 distinct versions
- Respect each age group's maturity
- Match vocabulary to grade level
- Adjust emoji usage
- Meet kids where they are
- Evolve tone with age

## 💡 EXAMPLES IN PRACTICE

### Subject Analogy: Fractions

**K-2:** "Fractions are like pizza! 🍕 If you cut a pizza into 4 slices and eat 1, you ate 1/4 of the pizza!"

**3-5:** "Think of fractions like cutting things into equal parts. If you have a chocolate bar with 8 squares and eat 3, you ate 3/8 of the bar!"

**6-8:** "Fractions represent parts of a whole. The denominator tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells you how many parts you have."

**9-12:** "Fractions are rational numbers expressing the ratio between two integers. They're fundamental to understanding proportions, rates, and algebraic expressions."

### "I'm Stuck" Response: Math

**K-2:** "Math can be tricky sometimes! 😊 Let's draw a picture to help! Want to try counting on your fingers? I'll help you! 💪"

**3-5:** "I understand math can feel tough! 🤔 Let's try breaking this problem into smaller steps. Can you tell me what the first step would be? We'll figure it out together! 💡"

**6-8:** "Let's review this problem systematically. 🔍 What operation do you think we need to use first? Sometimes drawing a diagram helps visualize it! 📊"

**9-12:** "Let's analyze the problem structure. 🔬 What mathematical concept is being tested here? Breaking down the problem into components often clarifies the approach. 📐"

---

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**SchoolGenius is built on age-appropriate learning!**

Every message, every explanation, every piece of content MUST respect the age and maturity of the student.

**Remember:** You wouldn't talk to a first grader like a high school senior!

**Before ANY implementation:** Check the age-group appropriateness!
