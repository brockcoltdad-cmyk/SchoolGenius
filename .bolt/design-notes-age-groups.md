# Age Group Design Guidelines

## Ages 5-13
- Playful, colorful theme system
- Animated characters (Gigi mascot)
- Celebratory animations (confetti, coin bursts, floating XP)
- Fun fonts and generous whitespace
- Encouraging language ("Yay! Great job!")
- Currency called "Coins"
- Prominent gamification elements

## Ages 14-17 (High School)
**Approach: Hybrid - Same architecture, refined aesthetic**

### Keep Consistent:
- Core UI architecture and layout
- Navigation patterns
- Feature access and functionality
- Overall structure

### Refine for Sophistication:
1. **Visual Refinements:**
   - More muted color palette
   - Less bouncy/playful animations
   - Cleaner, modern typography (no playful fonts)
   - More compact card layouts with less whitespace
   - Reduced particle effects and celebration intensity

2. **Tone Adjustments:**
   - Professional language: "Task completed" vs "Yay! Great job!"
   - Currency: "Points" instead of "Coins"
   - Gigi mascot: Less prominent or optional
   - Mature iconography

3. **Additional Features for High School:**
   - Study timer/Pomodoro tracker
   - GPA calculator
   - College prep task templates
   - Advanced goal setting and planning tools
   - More sophisticated progress tracking

### Philosophy:
Teens want to feel respected, not talked down to. Gamification is acceptable if it's **useful**, but must never feel childish. Think Duolingo's approach - gamified but never juvenile.

### Implementation Option:
Consider a "Classic View" vs "Streamlined View" setting that lets users choose their preferred aesthetic.
