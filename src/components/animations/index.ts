// Animation Principles Applied:
// 1. Squash & Stretch - Objects compress and stretch during motion
// 2. Anticipation - Brief wind-up before actions
// 3. Ease In/Out - Spring physics, never linear motion
// 4. Overshoot - Bounce past target, settle back
// 5. Secondary Motion - Related parts follow with delay
// 6. Follow Through - Parts continue after main action stops
// 7. Breathing - Subtle idle animations, never static
// 8. Particles - Celebration effects on success
